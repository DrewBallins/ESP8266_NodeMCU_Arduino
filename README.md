# ESP8266_NodeMCU_Arduino

PlatformIO project using the Arduino framework on an EPS8266 board connected to a DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor. This setup captures and sends indoor weather data to my IndoorWeatherServer running in parallel on a Raspberry Pi B+. Here is the server repo: https://github.com/DrewBallins/IndoorWeatherServerRpi
